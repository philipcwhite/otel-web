# otel-web
A monitoring website for OpenTelemetry data.  This is an extremely early working directory.  This project is a combination of my monitoring and collect three projects.  If all works as it should, it will be a simple kubernetes or docker container that can intercept and display opentelemetry data (logs, metrics, and traces) through a simple web UI.
